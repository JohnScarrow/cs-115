Slugger :snail: :sparkles:
Welcome to Slugger – Dive into the delightfully absurd world of Slugger where slugs wear bows, snail shells bounce like they're at a disco, and every millisecond counts!

In this zany game, you take on the role of either a dapper slug or a chic lady slug (complete with a fashionable red bow!), both striving to make their way to the top of the screen without becoming escargot. Can you dodge, weave, and slither your way past a barrage of bouncing snail shells?

Introduction
Slugger is a fun, fast-paced game where you guide a slug through perilous obstacles!

Random Character Variation: At the start, a second slug (the female character, complete with a snazzy red bow!) is available at random.

Dynamic Visuals: Enjoy smooth color transitions on obstacles and eye color changes each time the slug moves.

High Scores: Beat the clock and enter your name directly into the game when you top the leaderboard (preloaded with scores from Slugger and Slugget).

This project was developed as part of my Introduction to Computer Science class and is designed to showcase fundamental concepts like game loops, event handling, collision detection, and file I/O with JSON.

Features
Responsive Controls: Use the arrow keys to move the slug up, down, left, and right.

Obstacles with Style: Bounce along a series of snail shells with snazzy, color-cycling effects.

Strobing Effects: Experience dynamic screen strobing (red for collisions, green for wins) for that extra dash of excitement.

Real-Time High Scores: Your completion time is recorded, and if it's one of the fastest, you get to enter your name using an in-game text box. High scores are stored in a JSON file and displayed at the end of each session.

Female Character Variation: Sometimes, you'll play as a female slug with a red bow on her head – because every slug has style!

Usage
Movement: Use your arrow keys to move the slug around the screen.

Objective: Reach the top of the screen without colliding with any of the bouncing snail shells.

High Scores: Upon winning (or even losing), the high score list will display for 15 seconds. If your time qualifies as a high score, an in-game prompt will ask you for your name.

High Scores
The game automatically maintains a high score list saved in a high_scores.json file. The project is preloaded with two high scores:

Slugger with 30.0 seconds

Slugget with 40.0 seconds

Try to beat them!
